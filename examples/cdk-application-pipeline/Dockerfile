# Use multi-stage builds to scan newly created image with Trivy. This second stage 'vulnscan'
# isn't published to Amazon ECR and is never run. It is only used to run the Trivy scan
# against the newly created image in the 'build' stage.
#
# This stage must run as root so Trivy can scan all files in the image, not just
# those accessible by the nobody user. The user is swtiched back to 'nobody' at
# the end to ensure that even if this image is used for something it is done
# without the 'root' user.
